<p>The solution addresses the issue by restructuring the HTML.  Instead of nested inline elements, we use a more semantically appropriate approach.  This can involve using a list, or restructuring the content into appropriately nested block-level and inline elements.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is some text&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is now a separate paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is another paragraph with &lt;span&gt;inline emphasis&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
